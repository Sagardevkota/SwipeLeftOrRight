implementation 'com.github.Sagardevkota:SwipeLeftOrRight:Tag'


Features

getGesture();

## **Integration guide**

First Initialize GestureDetector instance and pass the context(this) and instance of our class(which also requires context as an argument) as an argument.



GestureDetector mGestureDetector = new GestureDetector(this, new swipe(getApplicationContext()));



## **Next Step**

Then add touch listener to your view where you want to handle user's gestures

---

   myview.setOnTouchListener(new View.OnTouchListener() {
            @Override
            public boolean onTouch(View view, MotionEvent motionEvent) {
              return false;
            }
        });


---

## **Override onTouchEvent method in your activity and check if the event was consumed or not**


      


    @Override
    public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event)
    {
        //method onTouchEvent of GestureDetector class Analyzes the given motion event
        //and if applicable triggers the appropriate callbacks on the GestureDetector.OnGestureListener supplied.
        //Returns true if the GestureDetector.OnGestureListener consumed the event, else false.

        boolean eventConsumed=mGestureDetector.onTouchEvent(event);
        if (eventConsumed)
        {
            //get gesture
            String gesture= new swipe(getApplicationContext()).getGesture();
            Log.d("direction is" ,gesture);
          

            switch (gesture){

                case "left":
                  break;

                case "right":
                    break;

                case "down":
                    break;

                case "up":
                 break;
                           }



            return true;
        }
        else
            return false;
    }
